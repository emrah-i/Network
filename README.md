<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This meticulously crafted forum web app serves as a testament to my abilities, offering a large array of features. I invite you to experience the application as a demo user.</p>
<p>This website was crafted with the intention to have it contain the principal features of social media apps like Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Initially, SoNet was going to be a simple clone one of the listed apps, however, I wanted to be more creative with the process. 
Eventually, it evolved into it's own unique app.</p>
<p>The construction of this project required the following tools<p>
<ul> 
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Django</li>
