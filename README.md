<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This meticulously crafted forum web app serves as a testament to my abilities, offering a large array of features. I invite you to experience the application as a demo user.</p>
<p>This website was crafted with the intention to have it contain the principal features of social media apps like Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Initially, SoNet was going to be a simple clone one of the listed apps, however, I wanted to be more creative with the process. 
Eventually, it evolved into it's own unique app.</p>
<p>The construction of this project required the following tools<p>
<ul> 
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Django</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>SQLite</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
    <li>Boostrap</li>
</ul>

<h3>Front End:</h3>
<p>The frontend of the project was developed using a combination of programming languages and tools, including <b>JavaScript, HTML, SASS, CSS, and Bootstrap</b>. To tackle this more complex project, I made a deliberate decision to concentrate on <b>JavaScript</b> in order to deepen my understanding of its core principles and concepts. This choice allowed me to significantly improve my <b>JavaScript</b> proficiency, as I was forced to expand my knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition to <b>JavaScript</b>, I also integrated <b>SASS</b> into the project. The reason for this was its more readable and concise syntax compared to standard <b>CSS</b>, which made managing styles considerably easier. The adoption of <b>SASS</b> improved the overall maintainability of the project's stylesheets, contributing to a more efficient development process.</p>
<p>To ensure the frontend's responsiveness and a polished appearance, I decided to utilize the <b>Bootstrap</b> framework. This choice allowed me to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and maintain a professional and refined look. By combining <b>JavaScript, HTML, SASS, CSS,</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>, I successfully crafted a frontend that met the project's requirements and provided me with valuable experience in these essential web development technologies.</p>
